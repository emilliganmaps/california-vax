        <h4 class="container,  text-center">2001-2015</h4><br>
        
        <div class="container" align="center">
        <p class="container, text-center">For the past 100+ years, vaccines have been revolutionizing healthcare. They provide a relatively low-cost, easy to attain preventative alternative to treatments for otherwise highlhy contagious and common diseases like chickenpox, measles, mumps, the flu, and diptheria. Just in the United States, vaccines are projected to save hundreds of thousands of lives and prevent millions of hospitalizations among children who were born between 1994-2014, but that doesn't stop people from being skeptical of their supposed side-effects. Misinformation runs rampant when it comes to vaccines, so many vaccine-preventable diseases continue to appear in outbreaks where they otherwise could have been eradicated.</p></div><br>
        
        <div class="container" align="center">
        <p class="container, text-center">In a state like California, where there are many large, densely populated urban areas, the threat of outbreaks is all too real. Between 2001 and 2015, despite the number of kindergarten students increasing dramatically over time, the number of parents reporting that their children received all their mandatory vaccinations did not, which is why the overall percentage of kindergarteners who were considered fully vaccinated dipped ever lower until around 2013.</p></div><br>

        <div class="container" align="center">
            <p class="container, text-center">These trends are also evident when you examine them spatially. While outbreaks due typically occur in dense urban areas, you can see them spike in years during and following those especially low reported vaccination rates. This map visualizes cases of pertussis recorded by the California Department of Public Health, by county and year.</p></div><br>

        <div class="container" align="center" id="map"></div>

        <div class="container" align="center"><br><p>The question is, do children whose parents have chosen not to vaccinate them (prior to 2016, this meant claiming a personal or religious belief exemption) end up clustering in certain schools or regions? And, if these clusters exist, might they be the cause of outbreaks of contagious, vaccine preventable diseases? </p><br></div>

        
        <div class="col-12">
        <div class="container, text-center"><strong><h4>But to understand why vaccines are so important, you need to understand herd immunity.</h4></strong></div></div><br>

        <img src="ca-vax/img/herdimmunity.png"></div><br>
        
        <div class="container" align="center">
        <p class="container, text-center"><strong>Herd immunity</strong> is the idea that when most of the population is vaccinated, those who are to young, too sick, or otherwise medically unable to receive vaccines will be protected from the spread of contagious diseases. For most vaccine preventable diseases, this requires around <strong>85-95% of the population</strong> to be vaccinated.</p></div><br>
        
        <div class="container" align="center">
        <p class="container, text-center">Measles was initially declared eradicated in the United States in 2000. But as you can see, that can not necessarily be said any more. With the rise of vaccine hesitancy comes annual outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases like measles and pertussis.</p></div><br>

        <p class="container, text-center">As you can see, the same "hot spots" appear in the same areas of the state in both maps, such as in Sacramento and Santa Cruz; in other words, areas which are undervaccinated have the potential to cause outbreaks no matter what disease is in question. Pertussis has a lower threshold for herd immunity than measles (85% versus 95% must be vaccinated), so although the same data is used in both maps, the data classification is different.</p></div><br>
